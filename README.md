### Java to Kotlin Migration

This repository is gradually migrating from Java to Kotlin. An automated workflow runs every Wednesday at 0:09 GMT to convert one Java class to Kotlin. The workflow creates issues that are handled by GitHub Copilot, which performs the conversion and creates pull requests.

For more information about the workflows, see [.github/README.md](.github/README.md).
